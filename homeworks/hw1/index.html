    <li>1. One thing I learned is that pretty much everything on an app/website is placed there with a specifc intent. Another thing is that when analyzing an app/website
        you should pay attention to hierarchy, content, audience and intent.

    <li>2. My favorite part of the article was where the author broke down elements of popiular apps and what their purpose is. Furthermore, the animations that 
        were included really helped with the hierarchy aspect of design and were really well done.

    <li> I would rate this article a 6 because it was short and contained useful information.</li>
