						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I learned from this article are the principles of Gestalt as they correspond to UI Design. Some of 
								these principles include emergence, proximity, symmetry and closure. Furthermore, when applying these principles its 
							important to keep coomunication, performance and convenience as the main goals.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the first few topics discussed whcih includes emergence, reification 
								and multi-stability. I find these concepts to be really interesting in general and seeing them applied 
								to UI design was really enjoyable. Furthermore, the examples included for these concepts were excellent and 
								reminded me how interesting the human brain is. </p>
