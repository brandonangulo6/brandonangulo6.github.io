					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> One thing I learned from this article is that there are many different types of dark designs that and 
							in general they make the user do something they didnt mean to. Some examples of this include bait and switch, disguised ads and forced continuity. 
						These types of dark designs are found almost everywhere and their main goal is to generate profit for a given company. In order to couneract this designers 
					must hold themselves to a moral compass that considers both the good of the company and the user. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article is that the author not only listed different kinds of dark design methods but also explained each one 
							and gave specific examples of each. The explanantions and examples were really useful in seeing how I interact with these dark designs almost everyday. Furthermore, 
						the examples help me understand what I should avoid doing in my own designs.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Dark Patterns is not a good, ethical practice and how designers should be responsible for their actions and focus on creating transparency with the users instead of manipulating them." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
