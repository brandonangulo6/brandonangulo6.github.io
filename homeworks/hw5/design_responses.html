                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> One thing I learned is that smooth animations are very captivating and should be utilized correctly. 
                                Another thing I learned is that using bright colors that contrast well is also very useful. Furthermore, 
                            using colors to guide the audience to the main aspects of the website is effective. Finally, there are many different 
                        types of transtitions and depending on the content they should be used differently.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is the many different kinds of examples that are given. The examples have many different 
                                purposes which means that they are useful for inspiration for our projects. In addition, the examples are of familiar things 
                            which means I can see how important aspects of design are applied to things I know.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration is the one of the Dark television series. It is my favorite because Ive enjoyed the show so Im a little 
                                bias but it also is very unique from other things I have seen. Just like the show its simple but when you actually look deep into it, it becomes 
                                even more complicated. Im assuming the goal of this website is to get people to watch the show and it does this by putting the 
                                main character on display and having the timeline on the side to empahasize a main theme of the show are done effectively to 
                                draw in viewers.
                            </p>
                        </li>
