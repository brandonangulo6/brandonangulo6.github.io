					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing I learned is that white space can help maintain focus, improve visual organization and increase readability. Furthermore, white 
								space is not wasted space because the users will continue to scroll and you have the benefits metioned above. Finally, keeping to multiples 
								of pixels for padding can be helpful.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the fact that examples were included to illustrate every point the author was making. They really helped visualize what the 
								author meant and how failure to include white space can have an unwanted effect. I also liked how it argues against the main anti-white space argument
								to solidify its importance. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Everyone has heard the saying "less is more". This applies to content on any given page, where less visual noise makes for a better user experience." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it a solid 8. It was informative and concise and had nice visuals. </p>
