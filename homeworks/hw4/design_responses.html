						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing I learned from this article is that there can be legal ramifications for not making your 
								website accessible. Another thing I learned is that having a backgound to text ratio of at least 4.5:1 
								is reccomended to help with color accessibility. Furthermore, you shouldn't rely fully on color and can use 
								symbols or other methods instead. Finally, its important that everyone on a team working on a website have access 
								to the colors so that color accessibility is made prominent.</p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the inclusion of resources that help practice the suggestions given 
								in the article. The resources are really great and they can help with future projects that we will work on. 
								I also like the included examples as they helped show the difference between good and bad practice when it 
								comes to color accessibility.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
