						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> One thing I learned is that we should try to imitate the real world when creating our animations. Furthermore, 
								the speed of an animation depends on the size of the screen and the duration of animation depends on distance traveled 
							and the size of the object. The curve of the speed of the animation should also be used carefully depending on whether the 
						object is entering, leaving, staying and other factors. The "choreography" of the items is also important. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the included examples with every point the author was making. The examples show the 
								good and bad and emphasize why the authors arguments make sense visually. Furthermore, the resources given to help with the 
							animation curves are helpful since you can use them to make custom curves. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "So, if we sum up all of the above-mentioned rules and principles, the animation in the interface should reflect the movements 
								that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc" </p>
						</li>
