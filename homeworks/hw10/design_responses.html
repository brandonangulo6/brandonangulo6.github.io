							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought that this article was really interesting since applying the concepts of psychology to UX shows how technology and the mind interact. It 
								has influenced my opinion in that I never really thought about the concepts that were being presented before. One really good example 
							was during the coktail party effect in which they explain what it is and then give an example of it in UX. Another good example was the divided vs focused 
						attention example since its something most people can relate to.  </p>
